# AlexLeeTest
This repo consists of two, main projects.

* The ReactJS application (provided for questions 7 & 8) is located in ui\alex-lee-app
  * **PLEASE NOTE** that there seems to be a bug within the npx Create React App generator. I could not get the lighteningcss web module to install via any form of `npm install` command.  However, if you install yarn and run `yarn add lightningcss`, it should install the application and allow it to properly run.
* The C# solution, containing all C#/MVC answers is located in the src directory.
